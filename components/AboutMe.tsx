const aboutMeParagraph = ' with experience in both the User Experience and User Interface sides of design. Design, art, and community are passions of mine and I am always excited to learn new things or new ways of doing things. I got into design when I came across a book entitled The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman and ended up buying it for myself. I was fascinated to think about the designs of everything around me and the process of ideating, creating, and implementing new designs for things that I use every day.';
