  'My name is Erika Lambe and I, until recently, was a full-time student who also worked full-time at Starbucks as a Barista/ Barista Trainer. During this time, I was able to hone my communication skills as well as other skills such as patience, empathy, organization, and improve my method of completing tasks.',
  'Working for such a busy company takes a lot of ability to stay calm during stressful situations and understanding your limits. It helped me understand how to be in tune with myself and know when I need to ask for help and feedback from my peers. Going to school full-time on the side also helped me stay organized and taught me how to do a deep dive on subjects that I didnâ€™t understand, continuously searching for new knowledge and new ideas.',
