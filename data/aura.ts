The results showed that most people who use some form of mood-tracking prefer the option of journaling, even if it's just to explain why they felt the way they did at the time. Others suggested adding audio clips, such as rain sounds and yoga poses, which was an interesting idea to explore. This debrief revealed that users of mood-tracking apps would like to be able to journal from their apps.",
